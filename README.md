Project Title: Analysing Trends and Factors Impacting the Olympic Athletes’ Performance and Achievements Over the Past 120 Years.

Statement: The Olympics is a global event that brings together athletes from various countries, representing diverse backgrounds and showcasing their talents across multiple sports. This project aims to explore Trends and Factors Impacting the Olympic Athletes’ Performance and Achievements Over time. 

We will answer the following key questions:

1.	Are there noticeable trends in the demographics of Olympic athletes across different years and sports?
2.	How do these demographic factors influence medal achievements in different sports and events?
3.	Are there variations in performance based on gender, country, and team characteristics?

We used the data set on the website www.sports-reference.com, including the Olympics data over the past 120 years.

The dataset includes information on Olympic athletes, with columns for:

Methodology 

Data Processing: 
We will clean the dataset to handle missing or inconsistent values, ensuring each record accurately represents an athlete’s demographic and performance details.

Potential Visualizations
•	Line Charts: Female proportions of Olympic players over time.

•	Bar Charts: Golden Age of Olympic players by gender or game.

•	Heatmaps: Visualize a specific country’s medal numbers by years and games 

•	Scatter Plots: Show relationships between athletes’ physical characteristics and their likelihood of winning medals in specific sports.
